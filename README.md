# working title monsters

monster-taming game where you find monsters in the world but the further out you go the stronger they are

and they're 2D but in a 3D world (like paper mario style) and most of them are booba

also monsters don't faint, instead they become yours when you defeat them

the monsters can come in different sizes, so you can have short milfmon or tall milfmon or bug-sized milfmon or giantess milfmon

gameloop is like a tycoon: you start with a monster, use them to fight+capture more monsters, sell those monsters to the merchant to get bucks, use bucks for fun stuff
