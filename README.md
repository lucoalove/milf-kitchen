# milf kitchen

cooking sim, tycoon gameloop. buy ingredients, cook food, sell food for money, repeat. unlock recipes to customize your menu. make friends with and employ milfs to get money multiplier. short ~1 hour experience.

2D game, ingredients have physics, when held they slowly spring to your mouse (with damp). nice pixel aesthetic since that's easy. also custom mouse cursor

unique character designs that aren't afraid to be a little ugly to be appealing/charming

can be played in browser (I know itch lets you do that for godot but idk how to set it up)
